# BTLO Blue Team Investigation Writeups

### A collection of blue team investigations, threat hunting exercises, and incident response case studies focused on real-world SOC workflows. Each investigation documents the analytical process used to identify, investigate, and understand security events through evidence collection, timeline reconstruction, IOC analysis, ATT&CK mapping, and reporting. 

<br>

### Topics span endpoint, network, identity, cloud, and threat intelligence investigations using industry-standard security tools and methodologies.
